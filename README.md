## Getting Started

### Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

- [node v20.17.0](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm 10.8.2](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [next.js v14.2.14](https://nextjs.org)

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
